# History of lAppUpdate

At the beginning, I searched a means to deploy application for my two personal
pc from a home server (based on [freenas](http://www.freenas.org/)). My
searches led me to the following products:

  * [OCS Inventory NG](http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/en/): it's a good choice for IT professional who manages thousands of PC, and an agent must be deployed on every PC.
  * Active Directory GPO: you can do this with a Windows Server or a server with [Samba configured in domain controller mode](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba_AD_DC_HOWTO). The main constraint is that GPO accept only MSI package.

So I choose to develop my own deployment system built around two main module :
the first one, named appdeploy, deploys application, the second one, named
appdownload, checks and downloads applications' updates if any (or the full
installation package).

# Requirements

The requirements for this project were:

  * appdeploy must run on windows 7 without prerequisites (I.e. no agent must be prior installed). Theses implies that this modules must be written in [Command shell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754340.aspx#BKMK_OVR) or [Windows Script Host](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d1wf56tt.aspx).
  * appdeploy must run from a network share (aka from a UNC path) or a removable disk (CD or DVD, USB stick...).
  * appdeploy must work with any type of installation package (MSI package, EXE package or a classic distribution with files and a setup.exe).
  * appdeploy must have pre install and post installation hook to customize the start menu or install additional packs (e.g. Firefox extension, VirtualBox Extension Pack, Tortoise Language Pack...)
